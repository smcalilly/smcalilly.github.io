This is a blog by Sam McAlilly. From now on, within this webpage and throughout the rest of the site which you're reading, I (Sam) will not refer to myself in third person. Libertating!

I'm from Mississippi and currently live in Birmingham, Alabama. I do stuff with computers (code) for my day job. I like to write fiction and essays in my free time. 

[Read about my intentions with this blog and why I wanted to start it.](/writing/2020/10/12/you-are-reading-sams-blog.html)

## Writing
- I'm revising a novella which I've worked on over the past five years. 
- I wrote and edited book reviews and blog posts when I worked at [Square Books in Oxford, Mississippi](https://squarebooks.com).
- I've helped [a Mississippi political figure write his memoir](https://medium.com/@smcalilly/tales-from-a-southern-undertaker-ac16aadd2191). I've ghostwritten some of his stories, edited some of his speeches, eulogies, and stories, and helped craft a narrative. 
- I've worked as a freelance writer for Meredith Corporation. I wrote video scripts for some lifestyle brands and improved SEO for various YouTube channels owned by Meredith.
- Occasionally I'll write some [technical guides](https://dev.to/smcalilly).

## Code
I currently work as programmer at [AutoTec in Birmingham](https://autotec.com/). I'm best with Python and JavaScript. I'm also experienced with Ruby on Rails. I know how to design and build single page apps with React. I can build serverless apps on AWS. I know how to deploy apps on Heroku. I know SQL, Docker, and how to do some stuff on Cloudflare. I also know how make a browser extension.

I have some side projects with code:
- I procrastinate from writing by working on [my writing app](https://highlighter.online/editor) to help my writing workflow. It has two components: 
    1. a browser extension to save notable passages of text while reading in the browser.
    2. a writing app with a text editor and API for the browser extension.
- I've begun prototyping and planning a [civic tech project](https://github.com/data-mississippi) so that I can help create more government transparency in Mississippi. If you're interested in that work, [please email me](mailto:smcalilly@gmail.com) because I need some help.
- I made [a soil moisture sensor](https://github.com/smcalilly/sensor) to use with a Rapsberry Pi. This is the project where I first learned to code Python.
- I used to work at Square Books in Oxford, Mississippi. I redesigned their website and improved their eCommerce sales by almost 20% in the first six months of the new site. This is how I first learned to code HTML and CSS.
