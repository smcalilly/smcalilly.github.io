Somebody said, “Redneck Disney World”  
A log cabin tacked onto the glass pyramid like a front porch  
On the lawn grows Deodar Cedar trees that aren’t native here  
We tourists hurrying in to witness the flagship mega store  
I guess this is another poem about "white culture"  
My people? I guess  
We buy Brands to wear across our chest, in society and sometimes in the woods  
We wear these clothes outside and dream about with our hands killing a deer skinning a fish a country boy can survive inside the Memphis Pyramid  
American flags and camouflage printed on Crocs  
Blue pilled skizzed out coffee bags with an AR-15 logo  
Neon signs for the Ladies Apparel, neon signs for the Sunglasses Hut  
I don’t know what this smells like. Various perfumes mixed together with wet dog  
Taxidermied ducks dangling in the air from monofilament string, stuck in flight  
Fishing boats for sale floating in the concrete swamp water. I want one  
Fake plastic cypress trees with Spanish moss draped from the limbs  
Largemouth bass swimming around in the pool  
We think it’s a boy eating catfish but it’s a four foot long sturgeon  
Mallards, blue bill ruddy, wood duck, wtf they doing in here?  
Reminds me of how the ducks walk through the Peabody Hotel on schedule  
Hog mannequins on concrete rocks at the stump of the cypress trees  
A boy climbs on a mini four wheeler and asks his dad if they can have it  
I wanna buy one too cause they got it pulled up next to the pools of water under the plastic trees and the ambient lights are low to make it somehow feel authentic. Looks like fun and makes me want to walk out of here with debt and a new four wheeler.  
They brought alligators into this motherfucking building and they live here!  
Trapped in a glass cage  
Carted them in with tanks and dropped them into the water  
They sit under the heat lamps and we watch them swim around  
Simulacrum or whatever this is
