they are going to the big dance
but they left their shoes
the dancing ones with the gold
returned home and lost on the way
found a new pair of shoes at the dancing store
unlost and walked all the way back home to get the dog
and they went to the big dance again
forgot the hair and went back
locked out of their apartment and the dog
hungry and thirsty
they break in but forgot the water was broken
and they forgot to buy the dog more food
nor can they find the hair
at the edge of the woods they see a rabbit
the hungry dog chases it
strong mouth grabbed it by the neck
and ringed it around and around til the neck snapped
they used the knife they found next to the dead rabbit
and turned the fur to a wig
so they walked back to the big dance
clothes all bloody, drop on the fake gold shoes
dried into dark blood splotches and the dog licks at it
a rabbit wig on top of his head
they are going to the big dance
