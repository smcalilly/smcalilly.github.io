This is a blog for me to write in public. I write a lot, privately, but not at all in public.

For whatever reason, I have no problem putting some rough and sometimes embarrassing demos on Bandcamp or making an [unfinished web app and putting it online](https://highlighter.online/editor). But I can't seem to make myself put my writing online. 

Here are some excuses why I don't share my writing: 
- Most of my writing isn't good enough to share. 
- My opinions sometimes change. 
- I'm dumb and wrong sometimes. 
- My blog writing tends to be too earnest for my taste, but, here I am, being earnest.
- I don't share my writing because I don't want my writing, myself, or my ideas to be rejected. (I hide it and never share it, not even with my dearest friends or family.)
- I don't want people to know who I really am.

So I'm gonna share some writing here and it might be good or bad. I might share some short fiction, or maybe some essays about history, literature, music, politics, race, gender, religion, business, tech, or writing itself. I just need an outlet to explore some ideas and become more serious with my writing. 

I used to share some writing on various social media sites (if you can call it that), but I had to get off of social media. I logged off, forgot my passwords, and deleted all the apps. Like everybody in 2020, regardless of the tuning of your echo chamber, my feeds were very negative and often made me angry or sad. I've realized about myself that I'm prone to be affected by the prevailing mood of other people in a physical space, and now I understand that a space can exist digitally, too. Basically I'm just saying that social media puts me in a bad mood. I'm also addicted to it and don't like that.

Since I've been off of social media, I've been annoying my friends and family with random texts and ideas and links to read. This will be a place to channel that. If you're a friend or a family member[^1], you can subscribe to [the RSS feed](/feed.xml). My mom doesn't use RSS, so I'll probably end up setting up a way for her to subscribe to my writing  via email.

[^1]: I don't know who else would care, nor am I sure if my friends or family would be interested.

I'll most likely edit posts after I've written them, because that's just what I do, constantly edit. I think that's another reason why I never share my writing, because it never feels done.

Most of the edits will be to improve the sentences, word choice, etc. Sometimes I'll read something a month later and have a better way of expressing it. If there are any huge changes, you can trust that I'll make footnotes and edits that keep the original arguments, etc in tact while considering new information, etc.

I reckon we'll see. Thanks for reading.
