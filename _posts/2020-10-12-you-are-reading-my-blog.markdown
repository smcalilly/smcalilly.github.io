This is a blog for me to write in public. For some reason, I have no problem putting some rough and often embarrassing demos on Bandcamp or making an unfinished web app and putting it online. But I can't seem to make myself put my writing online. 

Here are some excuses why I don't share my writing: 
- Most of my writing isn't good enough to share. 
- My opinions sometimes change. 
- I'm dumb and wrong sometimes. 
- My blog writing tends to be too earnest for my taste, yet, here I am, blogging.
- I don't share my writing because I don't want my writing, myself, or my ideas to be rejected. (I hide it and never share it, not even with my dearest friends or family.)
- I don't want people to know who I really am.

So I'm gonna share some writing here and it might be good or bad. What will the writing be, who really knows? I don't. I just need an outlet. 

I used to share some writing on various social media sites (if you can call it that), but I had to get off of social media. I logged off, forgot my passwords, and deleted all the apps. Like everybody in 2020, regardless of the tuning of your echo chamber, my feeds were very negative and often made me angry or sad. I've realized about myself that I'm prone to be affected by the prevailing mood of other people in a physical space, and now I understand that a space can exist digitally, too. Basically I'm just saying that social media puts me in a bad mood. I'm also addicted to it and don't like that.

Since I've been off of social media, I've been annoying my friends and family with random opinionated text messages or links to read. This might be a place to channel that. If you're a friend or a family member[^1], you can subscribe to [the RSS feed](/feed.xml). My mom doesn't use RSS, so I'll probably end up setting up a way for her to subscribe to my writing via email.

[^1]: I don't know who else would care, nor am I sure if my friends or family would be interested.

I'll most likely edit posts after I've written them, because I can't help but constantly edit. Might be another reason why I never share my writing, because it never feels done.

I reckon we'll see. Thanks for reading.
