[Cindy Lee released a new 2 hour long album *Diamond Jubilee*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LJi5na897Y). Interacts in my brain with all of the music I've heard from her, and the interviews I've read. I don't think I'll ever understand their work.

Music writer Matthew Perpetua [tweeted](https://twitter.com/perpetua/status/1778768336618148190):

> I've mentioned I hear Cindy Lee's *Diamond Jubilee* as a collected discography compilation, I think it breaks down neatly like this: 
> 
> 1-2 debut single  
> 3-6 EP  
> 7-16 first album  
> 17-26 second album  
> 27-32 EP of second album outtakes  
> 
> the second album is the masterpiece

[I responded](https://twitter.com/greenie_bean/status/1778786401472938474):

> i hear it as a two hour album with motifs that come and go throughout the entire 2 hours, like classical music. your break down is definitely "sections" but it sounds like a unified work to me

Then I went and read [his blog post about this album](http://www.fluxblog.org/2024/04/someone-to-believe-in/) and I liked what he said about it. I thought his idea of it being a discography was interesting. It's certainly plausible, as it would fit the girl pop star persona, and there's kind of a Bowie-like evolution. Maybe that's part of what's going on, but it doesn't explain everything. No problem, we are both writing our own interpretations of the art. We are sharing what we hear, subjectively with our life experiences and history of music listening.

I got a Twitter notification that Matthew Perpetua responded to my opinion:

> I respect that but honestly find that like 30% as interesting conceptually

He deleted this tweet less than a minute after he posted it. This provoked my defense mechanism. I'm on a lifelong journey of learning how to disagree with people in a reasonable way. My mother wrote in a Christmas card that I was 2 years old and would argue with anything.

"Find that like 30% as interesting conceptually" like ideas have percentages of interestingness. I wasn't going to let a popular music writer get away with deleting a tweet like that. It felt to me like a personal attack, and I responded with a screenshot of his deleted tweet and [said](https://twitter.com/greenie_bean/status/1778800248002888049):

> lol i respect this writer who deleted this tweet in response to me, but we shouldn't be applying music industry ideas like a "single" to an artist who does everything in opposition to the music industry. i find that like 30% as interesting, conceptually

With that last bit I reused his words, because I found it an insulting thing that didn't engage with my opinion, so I gave it back to him, because that's one of my flaws, just like anybody else, giving back what it felt like whether my feeling is right or wrong. Weird that I'm sharing this but it's a narrative frame for music writing criticism. He responded:

> I think it's weird that you'd think someone who made a record that sounds like this would not have obsessive interest in other artists' bodies of work, like that just wouldn't be plausible at all

Where did I say that? Obviously Cindy Lee is drawing on a ton of inspiration. [I tweeted](https://twitter.com/greenie_bean/status/1778802378788974939), "I never said that." and he responded:

> you're acting as though the notion of an ~imaginary single~ would be deeply offensive because they put out a record on geocities

I never said anything like that. I hate to pull the credentials, but I must defend myself. I've spent a lot of time listening to Cindy Lee's music. This is one of the artists who helped me through my 20s. You know the ones. I see how my comments could be interpreted where I think it's like some internet punk anti-industry cred whatever, but the content management system that they use to distribute their art is only a detail to me. 

I said, "i don't think twitter is a good place for either of us to explain our ideas. i'm curious to read a blog post about what you're trying to say." And he responded, "that's the full extent of the idea right there, it's just a way of looking at it and maybe making it easier to digest" and I said I would write a blog post about my ideas.

I disagree with thinking about *Diamond Jubilee* as a discography or splitting up this work of art so it is easier to digest, like a product from the music industry, where Cindy Lee never existed until [today when Pitchfork gave them a rave review](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/cindy-lee-diamond-jubilee/). Yet Cindy Lee uses some of these ideas to make their art. They eschew the industry and still play with what the industry created, which is 30% more interesting than my original idea, which makes it 130% more interesting than Perpetua's idea, which equals 1.3 if you move over the decimals, which means nothing to art. And also this isn't my idea, because I heard it in the artwork.

Here is my art interpretation, which I believe is fan fiction. I mean, goddamn, every single piece of music that has ever been made in the past 500 years might have a note included in this album. That's an exaggeration, but if you listen to the entire 2 hour album, multiple times, like at least a 10 hour commitment, you will find a unified work with musical motifs/themes/rhythms/grooves/melodies that weave in and out throughout the entire piece of work.  It's like a melodic or rhythmic or poetic fingerprint. This is most obvious with the outro loop that appears prominently near the beginning with "All I Want Is You",  "Wild One",  "Flesh Blood" (with the speed up that might be one of the album's major shifts?), middle with "Realistik Heaven", and very end with "24/7 Heaven".  ("Dallas" sounds like Elvis btw.) My god, fuck!, this does not need to be separated. There is even an 18th century seeming choral thing with "Le Machiniste Fantome" bridging the gap into modernity (cannot think of where this comes from right now but it's deep in my choir boy self who learned to sing at a church).  These shifts that feel like different albums are the elements of storytelling and mood. And I haven't hardly listened to the lyrics, will probably get into that in a couple of years after I've heard all of the notes and silence.

This is similar to the movements in a Beethoven symphony etc. It's like a play or film with multiple acts and themes weaved throughout. Cindy Lee is doing it with pop music in a 2 hour album. *Diamond Jubilee* is classical like that, with the awareness of the symphonic movements and maybe even Tin Pan Alley or maybe I'm wrong but certainly Elvis and the girl groups and no wave and everything in between, then after the 90s nothing is original, yet she combined all of these different influences to make something unique, especially with the exploration of gender identity.  You can even hear the transitions throughout the music. A 60 year old girl pop artist who mixes hits, noise, and classical-like movements, and this is her diamond jubilee magnum opus from 1964, but it feels futuristic and hopeful, fallen out of time and Cindy Lee's history, an angel, a timeless narrative, and not nostalgic.

This is my fan fiction. If she wanted the album to be delineated, then she would've released it like that. But she released a two hour album without singles. Reminds me of the lore about "Chaos of the Galaxy/Happy Man" by Sparklehorse. Mark Linkous didn't want a radio song, so he went back into the studio and deconstructed the song so they wouldn't put it on the radio.
