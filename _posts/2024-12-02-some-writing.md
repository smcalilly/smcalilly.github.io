This is a running list of where you can find my writing. Hopefully this list grows over the next decade:
- [Two Stories](https://muumuuhouse.com/sa.01nov2022.html) - *Muumuu House* was the first place to ever publish my writing. Thank you Tao.
- [*Forever Magazine VII: Made in the USA*](https://forever.metalabel.com/america) - My first piece in print, representing Mississippi in *Forever Magazine*'s America issue. Thank you, *Forever*.
- [Tales from a Southern Undertaker](https://medium.com/@smcalilly/tales-from-a-southern-undertaker-ac16aadd2191) - my profile on MS Representative Steve Holland. He is a friend and a colorful character.

I have an unpublished novel manuscript. I'm looking for an agent or an editor or a publisher who can help me publish it. Email me at smcalilly@gmail.com if you're interested in reading it.
