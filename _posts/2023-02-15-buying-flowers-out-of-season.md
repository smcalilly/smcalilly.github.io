I walked into Publix to buy some lunch stuff and the pink heart-shaped balloons drifted into my face. A man picked out a bouquet of roses wrapped in plastic. I saw one guy with his bouquet and box of milk chocolate and his balloon and I thought oh fuck I haven’t gotten her anything for Valentine’s Day. I had to walk through a big red rush of things just to get to the deli. Ephemeral like the rue anemone that’ll bloom then go away before the leaves fold out from the trees, but this display will be gone tomorrow and then they’ll try to make us spend our money on something else. 

A boy at the meat section and he had a heart-shaped red balloon floating above him and a plastic wrapped bouquet poking from his basket. Oh fuck I should buy us some red meat to eat, that seems romantic, cook my woman a steak. Oh wait she’s vegetarian.

Buying flowers that don’t even grow right now because today is the day of forced romance out of all the other days for romance, when you could pick some daffodils on the side of the road.
