Okie barked at Oliver and Ziggy playing in the yard across the street. He cried and asked to go play with them. I said that we weren’t invited and can’t just go into somebody’s yard like that. He laid down. 

We felt bad and drove him to the dog park. The dog park was muddy and no dogs were there. He walked around alone and smelled where dogs had been. Zoe and I ran around with him and played like dogs until we ran out of breath. We left the dog park and he threw up on the drive home.
