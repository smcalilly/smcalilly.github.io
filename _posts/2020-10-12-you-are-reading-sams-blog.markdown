This is a blog for me to write in public. I write a lot, privately, but not at all in public.

For whatever reason, I have no problem putting some rough demos on [my Bandcamp](https://secrethairs.bandcamp.com/) or making a [mediocre web app and putting it online](https://highlighter.online/editor). But I can't seem to make myself put my writing online. 

Most of it isn't good enough to share. Or that's the excuse I make. So I'm gonna share some writing here and it might be good or bad. I might share some short fiction, or maybe some essays about history, music, politics, business, race, gender, religion, or tech. I just need to write. I also need an outlet to explore some ideas. 

I used to share some writing on various social media sites, but I had to get off of social media. Like everybody in 2020, regardless of the tuning of your echo chamber, my feeds were very negative and often made me angry or sad. I've realized about myself that I'm prone to be affected by the prevailing mood of other people in a physical space, and now I understand that a space can exist digitally, too. Basically I'm just saying that social media puts me in a bad mood. I'm also addicted to it and don't like that.

Since I've been off of it, I've been annoying my friends and family with random texts and ideas and links to read. This will be a place to channel that. If you're a friend or a family member (I don't know who else would care), you can subscribe to [the RSS feed](/feed.xml). My mom doesn't use RSS, so I'll probably end up setting up a way for her to subscribe to my posts via email.

I'll most likely edit posts after I've written them, because that's just what I do, constantly edit. I think that's why I never share my writing, because it never feels done. My mind always changes.

That's not completely true. I also don't share my writing because I don't want my writing, myself, or my ideas to be rejected.

Most of the edits will be to improve the sentences, word choice, etc. Sometimes I'll read something a month later and have a better way of expressing it. If there are any huge changes, you can trust that I'll make footnotes and edits that keep the original arguments, etc in tact while considering new information, etc.

I reckon we'll see. Thanks for reading.
