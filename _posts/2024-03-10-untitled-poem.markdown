i have a billion year old rock sitting on my table  
and i once met a bear who was my age  
the bear carrying the rock  
flat maroon stone the size of a dinner plate  
it has waves like it was the bottom of the ocean floor  
because once it was the bottom of a green ocean floor  
and the sediment got all wavey under the water  
then the water left and the bottom exposed  
to air became a maroon rock  
a billion years later  
the rock is on a mountain where  
the bear ate through a thimbleberry bush  
and shit out some huckleberries  
scratched itâ€™s back on the lodgepole pine  
left a hair in the tree bark  
brown and golden strand in the windy sun  
all of this going on by the rock  
then the bear gave it to me
