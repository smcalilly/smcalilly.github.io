Aaron Bushnell self-immolated in protest to the ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people. His words:
> My name is Aaron Bushnell, I am an active-duty member of the United States Air Force and I will no longer be complicit in genocide. I’m about to engage in an extreme act of protest but, compared to what people have been experiencing in Palestine at the hands of their colonizers, it’s not extreme at all. This is what our ruling class has decided will be normal.

Fuck war. I refuse to accept the neccessity of it. I believe humans can achieve peaceful relationships in a world without war. Otherwise, there is no reason to live. What is the purpose of life if we choose to live in a world with war?

May all the Palestinian martyrs rest in peace.
